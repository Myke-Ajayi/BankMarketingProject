    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project focuses on OX bank that conducted a marketing campaign by phone calls, to increase the number of term deposits. A term deposit is a fixed term investment at a bank. Term deposits usually have shot term maturities ranging from one month to a few years. They also require varying levels of minimum deposits. The marketing divison havs asked the data science divison of OX bank to analyze their data from the previous campaign. The data science team decides to build a few machine learning models to give the marketing team some key predictions for the next campaign. \n"

    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We are in the data science division of bank and are working with the marketing team to see how they can conduct the campaign to get better results. To do this we performed various machine learning models to try to predict what features the marketing team should focus the campaign on. The stakeholders of this business problem are the bank executives and members of the marketing team. Marketing campaigns can be costly and it is important to have solid data and predictions before hand to plan it correctly. A bank needs customers and a good marketing campaign can directly correlate to raising the number of clients doing business with OX. Even if does not directly lead to a client signing deposit it can help get leads for the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "The deliverable for this project would be the analysis of the data through the use of a machine learning model. We are not delivering the model as the stakeholders are more focoused on results so they can translate it into a campaign. That being stated we will keep our models transparent as we are dealing with senstive banking data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It will be important to avoid false postives in our model. This means that we will predict the customer will sign a deposit when in reality they will not. This woudl be much worse for OX bank as a false negative would mean the client would still sign a deposit with the bank which is the overall goal of the campaign. The metric we are focused on optimizing would be precision. Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations. A higher precision means there is less chance of false positives which we want to avoid. \n",

    "The datasets we are working from, contain extensive client information such as the their job, marital status , whether they have credit in defualt, educational level etc. They target variable that we focused on was whether or not the client had subscribed a term deposit. This variable was binary so it simply stated \"yes\" or \"no\". The was very complete and had no missing values for each column. There was however quite a few categorical variables and well as numeric. \n",
