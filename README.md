# OX Bank Marketing Campaign 

## Overview

In this project we focused on making machine learning models to help a predict a future bank marketing campaign. We are looking for a certain set of features that the bank we are working for ,OX Bank, can translate into business ideas for their marketing campaign. OX Bank wants to boost the number of clients doing business with them. They want to do this by having clients subscribe term deposists with OX. We are not delivering a model here but rather an analysis based on the model used. 

## Busines Problem and Data Understanding 

The marketing team of OX bank is working with us, the data science divsionn, to achieve the goal of increasing the number of term deposits through the use of a marketing campaign. Marketing campaigns can be costly and time consuming so the marketing team wants to make sure they are putting resources into the right places when running the campaign. The dataset being used contains client information from the bank. This includes data such as client job, client marital status , duration of contact with client, last time client was contacted. The target variable of our predictions will be whether or not they suscribe a term deposist with the bank as this is the main overall goal of OX's marketing team.
