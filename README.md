# BankMarketingProject

## Overview

In this project we focused on making machine learning models to help predict
 a future bank marketing campaign. We are looking for a certain set of features that improves the 
 next campaign.
The dataset used contains client information and campaign infomation. The business problem is increasing the number
of term deposits
We did different combination of four types of models. 
A Decision Tree Classfier, Logistic Regression, KNN and Random Forest Model.
We first ran a model less evaluation of the target variable to check its distribution. 
The best of our models was the Random Forest Classifier. 
We used grid searching on most of the models to find the best hyperparameters 
and then tested the data on the training and hold out sets.
